Class
	tnbLib::chemistryReductionMethods::DAC

Description
	The Dynamic Adaptive Chemistry (DAC) method [1] simplify the chemistry
	using the matrix rAB defined by (DRGEP algorithm [2])

			|sum_i=1->Nr vAi wi dBi|
	rAB = --------------------------- ,
				max(PA, CA)

	PA = sum_i=1->Nr (max (0, vAi wi))  -> production of species A

	CA = sum_i=1->Nr (max (0, -vAi wi)) -> consumption of species A

	where i is the reaction index, Nr the number of reactions, vAi is the net
	stoechiometric coefficient of species A in the ith reaction (vAi = v''-v')
	, wi is the progress variable of reaction i and dBi equals 1 if reaction i
	involves B and O otherwise.
	rAB show the error introduced to the production rates of A when B and all
	the reactions including it are removed. It is computed as in [3] so that
	the algorithm is O(Nr).

	DAC uses a initial set of species that represents the major parts of the
	combustion mechanism, i.e. H2/O2, fuel decomposition and CO2 production.
	Usually, it includes the fuel, HO2 and CO. Then it computes the dependence
	of these set to the other species. This is done by introducing R-value
	defined by

	R_V0 (V) = max_SP(product(rij)),

	where SP is the set of all possible paths leading from V0 to V and
	product(rij) is the chain product of the weights of the edges along the
	given path. The R-value for the initial set species is 1.

	When the R-value of a species is larger than a user-defined tolerance
	then the species is included in the simplified mechanism. Otherwise,
	the species is removed along with all the reactions including it.

	During this process, instead of looking over all species like described
	in [1], the algorithm implemented here creates dynamic list to retain
	the initialized edges only (see [3]).
